= Introduction
In this report, we will explore the
various factors that influence _fluid
dynamics_ in glaciers and how they
contribute to the formation and
behaviour of these natural structures.

+ The climate
  - Temperature
  - Precipitation
+ The topography
+ The geology


Glaciers as the one shown in
@glaciers will cease to exist if
we don't take action soon!

= Methods
We follow the glacier melting models
established in @lamport1994latex.

= Math
The equation $Q = rho A v + C$ defines the glacial flow rate.

The flow rate of a glacier is
defined by the following equation:

$ Q = rho A v + C $
